# 💾 Jessica’s SQL Queries Repository

Hi there! 👋 Welcome to my SQL playground. Here you’ll find organized folders of SQL scripts I’ve created for practice, study, and real-world projects — all aimed at building my expertise in data analysis and database management. 🛠️

## 📚 What’s Inside

🔹 **basic/** — Fundamentals like SELECT, WHERE, JOINs, GROUP BY, and simple aggregations.  
🔹 **advanced/** — Window functions, recursive CTEs, complex subqueries, and other advanced SQL techniques.  
🔹 **data_cleaning/** — Scripts to clean messy datasets: deduplication, data type corrections, and transformations.  
🔹 **analytics/** — Analytical queries solving business problems such as sales trends, inventory movement, or customer segmentation.
